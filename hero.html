 <h2> Who Is Simone Biles? </h2>
 <p> Simone Biles is a 24 year old American gymnast. She has won a total of 19 olympic medals, as well as 25 world championship medals. To this day, she is considerbly one of the highest-ranking gymnasts in the world. Simone was raised in Spring, Texas, by her grandparents with her sister, Adria Biles. Her grandparents adopted her in 2000; she was six years old. Around this time, she became interested in the intense sport of gymnastics. </p>
 
 <h3> Why is Biles My Hero? </h3>
 <p> Simone Biles is very admirebale to me. She is not afraid to show her true charcter and strength. In the most recent olympics in Tokyo, she dropped out of the competion. At first, the reason was unknown, but she later expressed that she was not in the right mental state to continue in the games. In an interview with Biles, she further explains, "But once I came out here, I was like, â€˜no. Mental is not there, so I just need to let the girls do it and focus on myself." I find this very powerful.
