 <h2> Who Is Simone Biles? </h2>
  <p> Simone Biles is a 24 year old American gymnast. She has won a total of 19 olympic medals, as well as 25 world championship medals. To this day, she is considerbly one of the highest-ranking gymnasts in the world. Simone was raised in Spring, Texas, by her grandparents with her sister, Adria Biles. Her grandparents adopted her in 2000; she was six years old. Around this time, she became interested in the intense sport of gymnastics. She then quickly advanced, and was easily seen as a stand out. Then in 2016, at the Rio de Janeiro Games, she went on to be the first U.S gymnast to win 4 gold medals in one Olympic Games. </p>

 <h3> Why is Biles My Hero? </h3>
 <p> Simone Biles is very admirable to me. She is not afraid to show her true character and strength. In the most recent Olympics in Tokyo, she dropped out of the all around competition. At first, the reason was unknown, but she later expressed that she was not in the right mental state to continue in the games. In an interview with Biles, she further explains, "But once I came out here, I was like, â€˜no. Mental is not there, so I just need to let the girls do it and focus on myself." I find this very powerful. She is brave enough to take care of herself and her mental health, even when the whole world is watching. As a former gymnast, I find her very inspiring. Even with my local competions, the pressure was immense, I cannot even start to imagine the pressure of an Olympic Games.
